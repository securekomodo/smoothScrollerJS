# smoothScrollerJS
Smooth auto-scroller JavaScript with elliptical acceleration and deceleration — ideal for passive demo loops of website content

Scrolls downward in elegant, eased steps using an elliptical motion curve (slow start, fast middle, slow stop). When the bottom is reached, it scrolls quickly back to the top and pauses — creating a seamless loop ideal for portfolio sites, passive video demos, kiosks, or digital signage.

- Natural elliptical ease-in/ease-out motion (not linear or abrupt)
- Configurable scroll step, duration, and pause timing
- Auto-reverses at page bottom with fast return-to-top
- Long pause at the top before resuming loop
- Drop-in script — no dependencies

## Usage

Paste the script into your browser console or embed it in your site for a hands-free scroll loop:

```html
<script>
  // (Insert the full scroll script here)
</script>
